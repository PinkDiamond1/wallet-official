What is Bitcoin Clashic?
------------------------

Bitcoin Clashic was born from a Bitcoin genesis. 
Bitcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network.

The chain rose from the ashes of Bitcoin Cash (EDA consensus), that was cast off
in it's first hard fork to DAA consensus. It was dubbed Bitcoin Clashic. It came
to the calling of securing Bitcoin against brand attacks and became Bitcoin Core,
while adding strong two way replay protection. In it's journey, it has added 1-min
target blocks and adopted Blake2b PoW.

The core Bitcoin Clashic team has ambitious goals that will be announced soon in a
Whitepaper.

What is Bitcoin Clashic client?
-------------------------------

original name in early 2020.

Title Network is a rebrand of the [Bitcoin Core $BTCC Project](http://thebitcoincore.org),
Bitcoin Core Squared is a fork of the [Bitcoin Clashic Project](http://bitcoinclashic.org),
which itself is a fork of the [Bitcoin ABC Project](https://bitcoinabc.org),
